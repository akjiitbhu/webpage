			<h3>Journals related to Digital Forensics</h3>
				<p>Here are a few journals that cover digital forensics with their publishers and have a impact factor*:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law (JDFSL)- IOS Press - Impact Factor: 1.2</li>
						<li>Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility (JCSM) -  IOS Press - Impact Factor: 1.11</li>

					</ol>
					<p>*It's worth noting that Impact Factor is not the only metric to evaluate the quality of a journal and the relevance of the articles published in it to
					specific fields like digital forensics. It's also recommended to check the content and authors of the journals, besides the impact factor.</p>
					<p>#It's worth noting that some of the journals may have changed their publisher since my knowledge cutoff date or have more than one publisher. 
					Some of the journals also have online versions that can be accessed through open access.</p>
